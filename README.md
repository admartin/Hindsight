##How to Run The Bot
    In order to run the bot, you need to change directory (cd) into the botCode folder,
    after that you need to run the following command: node bot.js. Once that command is 
    executed the bot will start running and populating the server. 
    
##How to Use the Website
    Using the website itself is very straight forward, the landing page (index.html) prompts
    you to search for a specific twitter username, assuming the user is in our database you
    will be able to see his or her tweets. The trends portion of the website will display
    useful chart information about the user's tweets and their categorization along with the
    rest of our database to allow comparisons between the user and the rest of twitter.
